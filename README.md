# Covid-19-India

Combining the Data Analysis done using Python and the Graphical  Representation done in Tableau, we can draw the following Inferences:
1] Spread of the number of cases in top 5 states contributed to approximately half of the countryâ€™s total cases in 2020 as well as in 2021.
2] There  was  only  a  single  wave  in  the  country till January 2020 (as seen from the upward trend in the graphs) but now as the no. of cases are on a steep rise, we can expect another lockdown soon enough.
3] Positive  percentage  kept  on  reducing  as  the  year 2020 progressed. But due to slow implementation of vaccination program as well as leniency in Covid protocols, India saw a huge spike in the 2nd wave.
4]We saw a huge downfall in the no. of cases from the Month of June 2021 which gave the Govt. of India an opportunity to boost manufacturing and supply chain
5] Goa, Chandigarh and Himachal had highest PoPV while it was the least in UP, Bihar.
